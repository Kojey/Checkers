# Checkers
Checkers game made for an assignment in CSC1016S,2014.
Game has its own set of rules that can be found in the game (click on the help button)
# Coding
I made the game when I was in first year computer science and I didn't know anything about Makefile. As I wanted to upload 
the program as it was when I submitted that assignment, I did not add a make file. Fortunately, the section info gives some details about the java class of the game.
# Info
The file checkers.java is the file that need to be ran provided that all the other class are compilled.
